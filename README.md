## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## ContributorNotes

Hi !

This project has been modified by Matheus Talpe as a final project for the Udacity's Front-End Fundamentals Course.

Below, there's a list of online repositories that are needed to run this game:

* [BootsTrap](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css)
* [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coda)

## Important
In order to run the game, you'll need an active internet connection. Otherwise the game won't be able to access the above mentioned dependencies and should not run as expected.

## How to Play

* Run the [index.html] file in the game directory.

* Just click on any card to start.

* To win the game, you must match all the pairs.

* If you wish to restart, just press the restart button located at the right side of the "Moves" counter.

* Your score will be based on the amount of moves(clicks on cards) used to match all pairs. The more moves you make, less stars you'll get.  

Good luck !
